                            Dolphins are small-toothed cetaceans easily recognizable by their curved mouths, which give them a permanent “smile”.
                            Dolphins feed chiefly on fish and squid, which they track using echolocation, a built-in sonar that bounces sound waves off prey and reveals information like its location, size, and shape. An echolocating bottlenose dolphin can make up to a thousand clicking noises per second.

                            The Clownfish is a striped yellow, black, and white fish with two beady black eyes on the side. It has two fins on its side, a double fin on its back and underside, and a large tail fin, all of which are outlined in black.
                            They feed on pellets, frozen foods and live foods.

                            Crocodiles (family Crocodylidae) or true crocodiles are large semiaquatic reptiles.
                            They particularly enjoy eating a snake or a fish (for them, it can be considered as some kind of appetizer), deer, baby elephants, cows, carrion, gazelles, wild boar, buffaloes and kangaroos.

                            Jellyfish are mainly free-swimming marine animals with umbrella-shaped bells and trailing tentacles, although a few are anchored to the seabed by stalks rather than being mobile
                            They can eat anything from eggs or larvae to crustaceans or even small fish.

                            Octopus are soft-bodied, eight-limbed molluscs of the order Octopoda.Like other cephalopods, an octopus is bilaterally symmetric with two eyes and a beak, with its mouth at the center point of the eight limbs.
                            octopuses primarily feed on mollusks, polychaete worms, and crustaceans such as clams, birds, shrimps, lobsters and snails.

                            Penguins are a group of aquatic flightless birds. Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage and flippers for swimming.
                            Penguins are carnivores they feed on Silverfish, lantern fish, sprats, pilchards, mullets, anchovies, sardines, cod, opal fish, and other small fish.

                            Sea turtles are characterized by a long, streamlined shell. Depending on the species, sea turtles color range can be olive-green, yellow, greenish-brown, reddish-brown, or black. Limbs and flippers are adapted for swimming.
                            Their diet consists primarily of algae, seagrasses, and seaweed.

                            Sharks are a group of elasmobranch fish characterized by a cartilaginous skeleton, five to seven gill slits on the sides of the head, and pectoral fins that are not fused to the head.
                            A carnivorous shark diet usually includes fish, mollusks, and crustaceans. Large species also consume marine mammals such as dolphins, seals, sea lions, and porpoises.

                            Whales are the largest animals on Earth. They have sleek, streamlined bodies that move easily through the water. They are the only mammals, other than manatees (seacows), that live their entire lives in the water.
                            They feed on krill, but sometimes include other sea creatures in their diets, such as copepod crustaceans and small fish.

                             The word cetacean is used to describe all whales, dolphins and porpoises in the order Cetacea.
                             This word comes from the Latin cetus meaning "a large sea animal," and the Greek word ketos, meaning "sea monster."
                             Cetaceans range in size from the Hector's dolphin, which is just over 39 inches long, to the largest whale, the blue whale, which can be over 100 feet long.

                        <td>
                            The word "pinniped" is Latin for wing- or fin-footed. The pinnipeds are in the order Carnivora and suborder Pinnipedia, which includes all the seals, sea lions, and the walrus. 
                            There are three families of pinnipeds: the Phocidae, the earless or ‘true’ seals; the Otariidae, the eared seals, and the Odobenidae, the walrus.
                            These three families contain 33 species, all of whom are well-adapted for a life spent on both land and in the water.

                            Sirenians are animals in the Order Sirenia, which includes manatees and dugongs, also known as "sea cows," probably because they graze on sea grasses and other aquatic plants.
                             This order also contains the Steller's sea cow, which is now extinct.

                            The mustelids are the group of mammals that include weasels, martens, otters, and badgers.
                            Two species in this group are - the sea otter (Enhydra lutris) , and the sea cat, or marine otter (Lontra felina).
